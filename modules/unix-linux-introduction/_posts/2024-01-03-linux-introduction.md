## Linux
<br>

A Linux distribution, often known as a Linux distro, is a whole operating system
based on the Linux kernel. It is made up of the Linux kernel, core system libraries,
user applications, utilities, and a variety of software packages that work together to
offer a functional computer environment.

#### Why is LINUX commonly used by bioinformaticians

- Linux is commonly used in scientific computing because it is Open Source and has
attracted many different contributors.
- Linux's command line interfaces CLI enables bioinformaticians to handle data, automate
tasks, and run complex research pipelines. The CLI processes large volumes of data, text
files, and bioinformatics applications.
- Linux-optimized bioinformatics tools are plenty. Alignment, sequence analysis, genomics,
proteomics, and statistical analysis methods are used by researchers.
- Scalability and speed allows Linux to perform computationally difficult tasks including
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and genomic analysis. Bioinformaticians can analyze
data quicker using multi-core processors and distributed computing systems

#### Commonly used Linux Distributions
1. Ubuntu: Ubuntu is one of the most widely used Linux distributions. It focuses on ease of
use and provides a user-friendly interface. It has both a desktop version and a server
version.
2. Debian: Debian is a stable and highly customizable distribution. It emphasizes free and
open-source software. Many other Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, are derived from
Debian.
3. Fedora: Fedora is a community-driven distribution sponsored by Red Hat. It aims to
showcase the latest technologies and software in the Linux ecosystem. It is known for its
strong focus on security and new features.

- Apple’s MacOSX Terminal
- Window’s Terminal
- Others: PuTTY, MobaXTERM

Both OSX and Windows provides a program called Secure Shell/Secure Shell Socket (SSH). 
SSH allows you to use a terminal emulator running on your computer to connect to remote computers.
