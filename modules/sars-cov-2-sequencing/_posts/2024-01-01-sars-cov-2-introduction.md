## Introduction to SARS-CoV-2 genomics and bioinformatics analysis
<br>

In early January 2020, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for a
pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified using next-generation
sequencing (NGS) and readily available bioinformatics pipelines. In addition to
virus discovery, these NGS technologies and bioinformatics resources are
currently being employed for ongoing genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2
worldwide, tracking its spread, evolution and patterns of variation on a global
scale.

## Scope
In this short workshop we will tackle, hands-on, the basic principles employed
by the numerous bioinformatic pipelines: to generate consensus genome sequences
of SARS-CoV-2 and identify variants using an actual dataset generated in our
facility.

**Note**
This is part of the initiative fronted by the [Africa
CDC](https://africacdc.org/) with generous support from the [Rockeffeler
foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/) to build capacity in
pathogen genomics in Africa.

<br>

## Objectives

We aim to provide intensive hands-on training on genomics and bioinformatics for
12 participants from public health institutes in 11 countries in Africa.
Participants will gain in-depth and foundational principles and skills on
sequence data generation and analysis using bioinformatics tools with an aim of
translating this knowledge into actionable steps in outbreaks investigation and
control.
