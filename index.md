Building capacity in pathogen genomics and bioinformatics in Africa:
This training course aims to provide intensive hands-on training on genomics and
bioinformatics to participants from national public health institutes (NPHIs) in
Africa. Participants will gain in-depth and foundational principles and
skills on sequence data generation and analysis using bioinformatics tools with
an aim of translating this knowledge into actionable steps in outbreaks
investigation and control for public health surveillance

<!-- #### About Course-in-a-Box

P2PU created Course-in-a-Box in 2014 as a free and lightweight tool for building online courses. We wanted to preserve the modular structure of MOOCs outside of the bulky (and often proprietary) environment of learning/content management systems. Course-in-a-Box is open-source, and we welcome contributions [on our Github repo](https://github.com/p2pu/course-in-a-box).

p.s. Designing a course for learning circles? [Check out the Learning Circle Course Creation guide](https://docs.p2pu.org/courses/creating-courses) for some best practices on course design. -->
